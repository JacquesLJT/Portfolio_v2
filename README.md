# Your Portfolio Website v2

A new version of your portfolio website built using Vue, Nuxt, and ChakraUI.

This is the second version of my portfolio website, built using Vue.js and Chakra UI. I wanted to create something that would set me apart from other students and job applicants, so I decided to build a portfolio website that showcases my skills and abilities.

Before building the first version of my portfolio website, I had no experience in web development. However, I was eager to learn and took the initiative to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Within a few weeks, I was able to start work on the first version of my portfolio using React.js. Although I had no prior web development experience, I was happy with the results and proud to show my portfolio to potential employers and colleagues.

For the second version of my portfolio, I wanted to improve upon the first version and also learn a new framework. I chose to use Vue.js and Chakra UI, as I had heard good things about Vue.js and had previous experience with Chakra UI. I'm pleased with the results and excited to continue building on this project.

## Special Directories

The following extra directories are included in the project, each with a specific purpose:

- `assets`: Contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.
- `components`: Contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.
- `layouts`: Contains different layout options for your Nuxt app.
- `pages`: Contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the *.vue files inside this directory and set up the Vue Router automatically.
- `plugins`: Contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application.
- `static`: Contains your static files, each of which is mapped to the root directory.
- `store`: Contains your Vuex store files, which are automatically activated.

For more information about these directories and their usage, check out the Nuxt.js documentation.
